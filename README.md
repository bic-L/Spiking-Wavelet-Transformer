### Key points

The "***Spiking Wavelet Transformer***" introduces an innovative approach to enhancing spiking neural networks (SNNs) by integrating wavelet transforms with transformer architectures in an attention-free fashion. This method addresses the challenge of effectively capturing high-frequency patterns crucial for event-driven vision tasks, unlike self-attention, which prioritizes low-frequency elements. Key features include:

- **Frequency-Aware Token Mixer (FATM):** Learns spatial-frequency features without relying on self-attention.
- **Spiking Frequency Representation:** Processes data efficiently in a spike-driven, multiplication-free manner.
- **Enhanced Performance:** Offers improved accuracy and reduced parameter count on datasets like ImageNet.

This approach provides a practical solution for advancing energy-efficient, event-driven computing.
